Verse : 01

 The apostle John wrote this to Christians.
  # That which was from the beginning 
   The phrase “That which was from the beginning”
  refers to Jesus, who existed before everything was made. You could translate this as “We
  are writing to you about the one who existed before the creation of all things.”
  # the beginning 
   “the beginning of all things” or “the creation of the world”
  # which we have heard 
   The phrase “which we have heard” refers to what Jesus taught
  them. It can be translated as “We heard him teach.”
  # we 
   In verses 1 and 2, the word “we” refers to John and those who knew Jesus when he
  was on this earth, but it does not include the people John was writing to. (See: Exclusive)
  # which we have seen with our eyes, which we have contemplated 
   “We ourselves have
  seen him.”
  # and our hands handled 
   “we have touched him with our hands”
  # the Word of life 
   This refers to Jesus. “He is the one who causes people to live forever.”
  # the life was manifested 
   This refers to Jesus’ coming to earth. It can be translated as
  “God sent him to the earth” (See: Active or Passive)
  # and we have seen 
   “and we saw him”
  # and bear witness 
   “and are telling you about him”
  # the eternal life 
   This phrase also refers to Jesus, who causes us to live forever. It can be
  translated as “that he causes us to live forever.”
  # which was with the Father 
   “He was with God the Father”
  # and was manifested to us 
   “but he came to live among us” (UDB) 

Verse : 03

 # that which we have seen and heard we declare to you also 
   “We declare to you also
  what we have seen and heard”

   These pronouns refer to John and those who saw Jesus’ alive and are now
  teaching people about it. (See Exclusive)
  # you 
   The word “you” is plural and refers to the people John was writing to. (See: Forms
  of ‘You’)
  # have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father
   The word fellowship
  here is referring to a close friendship. These clauses could be translated “be our close
  friends and we are friends with God the Father”
  # our fellowship 
   It is not clear if John is including or excluding his readers. You may
  translate this either way.
  # Christ 
   The word Christ is a title, not a name and it means “the chosen one”. Here it is
  referring to God choosing Jesus to be our savior.
  # that your joy may be made complete 
   “to make your joy complete” or “to make you
  completely happy” (See: Active or Passive)

  # God is light 
   This means that God is perfectly pure and holy. It can be translated as “God
  is purely righteous like pure light.” Cultures that associate goodness with light may be
  able to keep the idea of light without explaining the metaphor. (See: Metaphor)
  # in him there is no darkness at all 
   This means that God never sins and is not evil in
  any way. It can be translated as “in him there is no darkness of sin.” Cultures that associate
  evil with darkness may be able to keep the idea of darkness without explaining the
  metaphor.

   In verses 6
  7 the pronouns “we” and “us” refer to all believers, including the

  # deceive 
   “trick” or “fool”
  # the truth is not in us 
   “we do not believe what he said is true”

   These pronouns are probably referring to Jesus, but they may refer to
  God the Father. It is best to leave the pronouns ambiguous if your language will allow it.

Verse : 01

 # My dear children 
   John was an elderly man and their leader. He used this expression
  to show his love for them. It can be translated as “My dear children in Christ” or “You
  who are as dear to me as my own children.” (See: Metaphor)
  # these things I write 
   “I am writing this letter”
  # But if anyone sins 
   This is something that is likely to happen. “But when anyone sins”
  (See: Hypothetical Situations)

  3 these words refer to John and the people he was writing to. (See:
  Inclusive)

  forgive us”

   “and that person is Jesus Christ, the only one who is
  perfect”
  # He is the propitiation for our sin 
   “Jesus Christ voluntarily sacrificed his own life for
  us, so that as a result God forgives our sins” (UDB)
  # By this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments 
   The phrase “we
  know him” means “we have a relationship with him.” This can be translated as “If we
  do what he tells us to do, then we can be certain that we have a good relationship with
  him.”
  # him…his 
   These words could refer to God or to Jesus. (See: Ambiguity) 

Verse : 04

 # He who says 
   “Anyone who says” or “The person who says”
  # I know God 
   This could be translated as “I have a good relationship with God.”

  # his commandments 
   “what God tells him to do”
  # the truth is not in him 
   “he does not believe what God says is true”
  # keeps 
   “does” or “obeys”
  # his word 
   “what God tells him to do”
  # the love of God 
   Possible meanings are 1) “our love for God” or 2) “God’s love for us.”
  # truly in that person the love of God has been perfected 
   This can be translated as an
  active sentence: “But those who obey what God commands them to do are the people
  who love God in every way” (UDB) or “God’s love for people has achieved its goal when
  they do what he tells them to do.” (See: Active or Passive)
  # By this we know that we are in him. 
   The phrase “we are in him” means that the
  believer is always united with God or has continual fellowship with God. Often in 1 John
  the phrase “remain in him” is used to mean the same thing. This can be translated as
  “When we obey what God says, we can be certain that we have fellowship with him.”
  # he remains in 
   “he has a relationship with”
  # ought himself also to walk even as Jesus Christ walked 
   “must live has Jesus Christ
  lived” or “should also obey God just as Jesus Christ did” 

Verse : 07

 # Beloved 
   This can be translated as “Friends” or “Dear believers in Christ”
  # I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment 
   John was referring
  to Jesus’ command to love one another. This could be translated as “I am writing
  to you to love one other. That is not a new thing to do but an old commandment that you
  were told.”
  # from the beginning 
   “from when you first believed in Christ” (See: Explicit and Implicit)
  # Yet I am writing a new commandment to you 
   This can be translated as “But in one
  way the commandment I write to you is new.”
  # which is true in Christ and in you 
   This can be translated as “It is new because what
  Christ did was new, and what you are doing is new.”
  # the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining 
   Here “darkness”
  refers to evil and “light” refers to goodness. This can be translated as “because you are
  ceasing to do evil and you are doing more and more good.” (See: Metaphor)
 

Verse : 09

 # He who says 
   “Anyone who says” or “Those who claim” (UDB). This does not refer to a
  specific person.
  # he is in the light 
   This is a way of speaking about living right. When people do what is
  right, they can do it in the light, and not hide in the dark. This can be translated “he does
  what is is right” or “he is in the light doing what is right.” (See: Metaphor)
  # is in the darkness 
   This is a way of speaking about living sinfully. When people do what
  is wrong, they like to hide in the dark. This can be translated as “is in the darkness, doing
  what is evil.”
  # there is no occasion for stumbling in him 
   “nothing will cause him to stumble.” The
  word “stumbling” is a metaphor that means to fail spiritually or morally. This could be
  translated as “nothing will cause him to sin” or “he will never fail to do what is pleasing
  to God.”
  # is in the darkness and walks in the darkness 
   This same idea is said twice to bring
  attention to how evil it is to hate a fellow believer. This could be translated as “is living
  in darkness” or “is living in the darkness of sin.” (See: Doublet)
  # he does not know where he is going 
   This is a metaphor that can be translated as “he
  does not even know he is doing what is evil.”
  # the darkness has blinded his eyes 
   “the darkness has made him unable to see.” This
  could be translated as “sin has made it impossible for him to understand the truth.” 

Verse : 12

 # dear children 
   See how you translated this in 2:1.
  # your sins are forgiven you 
   This can be translated with an active clause: “God has
  forgiven your sins” (UDB). (See: Active or Passive)
  # for Christ’s name’s sake 
   “Christ’s name” is a metonym which refers to Christ and all he
  has done.“ This could be translated as “because of what Christ has done for you” (UDB).
  (See: Metonymy)
  # I write to you, fathers 
   The word “fathers” here is a metaphor and refers to mature
  believers. This could be translated as “I write to you, mature believers.”
  # you know 
   “you have a relationship with”
  # him who is from the beginning

  existed.” It refers either to “Jesus” or to “God the Father.” (See: Ambiguity)

  growing in spiritual maturity. This could be translated as “young believers.”

 # Do not love the world 
   In 2:15
  17 the word “world” refers to all the the things people
  do and the the things they want that do not honor God. This could be translated as “Do
  not behave like the people in the world who do not honor God” (UDB). (See: Metonymy)
  # nor the things that are in the world 
   “and do not want the same things those who
  dishonor God want”
  # the love of the Father is not in him 
   This means “he does not love the Father.”
  # If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him 
   This can be translated
  as “A person cannot love this world and all that dishonors God and love the Father at the
  same time.”
  translationNotes
  # the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vain glory of life 
   This is a list of
  some of the things in the world. It explains what is meant by “everything that is in the
  world.”

   “the strong desire to have physical pleasure”
  # the lust of the eyes 
   “the strong desire to have things that we see”

  and wealth.

 # Little children 
   See how you translated this in 2:1.

  to the earth and judges all people. This can be translated as “Jesus will return soon.” (See:
  Metonymy)
  # by which we know 
   This can be translated as “and because of this we know” or “and
  because many antichrists have come, we know.”
  # many antichrists have come 
   “there are many people who are against Christ.”
  # They went out from us 
   “They left us”
  # but they were not of us 
   “But they did not really belong to us anyway” or “they were
  not really part of our group in the first place.” The reason they were not really part of
  the group is that they were not believers in Jesus.
  # For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us 
   This could be translated
  as “Because, if they were really believers they would not have left us.”
  # they went out in order that they might be shown that they are not of us 
   This can
  be stated with an active clause: “they left us so that God could show us they were never
  really believers.” (See: Active or Passive) 

Verse : 20

 # But you have an anointing from the Holy One 
   “But the Holy One has anointed you.”
  In the Old Testament “anointing” refers to pouring oil on a person to set him apart to
  serve God. Here “anointing” refers to Jesus giving the Holy Spirit to believers to set them
  apart to serve God. This could be translated as “But Jesus Christ, the Holy One, has given
  you his Spirit.” (See: Metaphor)
  # no lie is of the truth 
   “no lie comes from the truth.” The phrase “the truth” may refer
  to God, the one who is full of truth. This could also be translated as “No lie comes from

  Question)

  # confesses the Son 
   “speaks the truth about the Son”

   “remember and
  believe what you have heard from the beginning.” How they heard it, what they heard,
  and what “the beginning” means can be made explicit: “continue to trust what we have
  taught you about Jesus just as you have trusted since you first became believers.” (See:
  Explicit and Implicit Information)
  # that which you have heard from the beginning 
   This can be translated as “what we
  taught you about Jesus when you first became believers.”

  hates another believer is as guilty as someone who kills a person.” (See: Metaphor)

   “Eternal life” is something God gives believers after we

  This could be translated as a statement: “God’s love is not in him.” (See: Rhetorical Question)
  # My dear children 
   See how you translated this in 2:1.# let us not love in word nor in tongue 
   The phrases “in word” and “in tongue” mean
  basically the same thing. They refer to what a person says. This can be translated as “do
  not just say you love people.” (See: Doublet and Metonymy)

   This could be translated as “but show that you truly love people
  by helping them.” 

Verse : 19

  those who love their fellow believers have become God’s children and know him.”
  (UDB)
  # He who loves not knows not God, for God is love 
   This can be translated “God’s nature
  is to love all people. Those who do not love their fellow believers do not know God
  because the character of God is to love people.”
