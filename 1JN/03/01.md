 # See what kind of love the Father has bestowed on us 
   “Think about how much our
  Father loves us” (UDB)
  # bestowed upon us 
   “given to us” or “shown us”
  # us…we 
   In 3:1
  3 these pronouns refer to John, his audience, and all believers.(See: Inclusive)
  # we should be called children of God 
   This can be translated with an active verb: “the
  Father should call us his children.” (See: Active or Passive)
  # the world does not know us, because it did not know him 
   Here “the world” refers
  to people who do not honor God. What the world did not know can be made explicit:
  “Those who do not honor God do not know that we belong to God, because they did not
  know God (See: Metonymy and Explicit and Implicit Information)
  # it has not yet been revealed 
   This can be translated with an active verb: “God has not
  revealed”
  # And every one that has this confidence fixed on him purifies himself just as he is
  pure. This can be translated “Everyone who confidently expects to see Christ as he really
  is will keep himself pure because Christ is pure.”
